Welcome! If you are new with this kinda stuff, it will be very simple to you, trust me.
First of all, **Make sure you have Go installed.**, for more info, click [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

**IF YOU ARE COMPILING THE SOURCE**
Run `go build /path/to/luna/dir/src/main.go`. :) 

...Otherwise, just run the executable and you should be good to go
