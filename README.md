Luna
====

A SNES, N64, and GameCube game downloader made in [Go](http://golang.org)

Introduction
------------

Welcome to Luna! Luna is a downloader that downloads Super Nintendo games, Nintendo 64 games and \*Nintendo GameCube games (\* = select titles only)

To install Luna, you must have **Go** installed, which you can find [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

Once you have Go installed, you have 2 options to get the executable up and running.

1.  You may compile the source code, reccomended option for all platforms
2.  You may download the executable from the **Releases** section

If you choose to do 1, run `go build /path/to/luna/main.go` in your command prompt or terminal. It may take a little bit, so go ahead and continue reading this while you are at it.

Running the Program
-------------------

Once that is compiled, you'd probably want to run `./luna.exe -h` in a command prompt (Windows) or `./luna -h` in a terminal (Linux, MacOS, and UNIX-like systems), to get help on how to use Luna.
