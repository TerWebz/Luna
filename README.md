Welcome to Luna! Luna is a downloader that downloads Super Nintendo games, Nintendo 64 games and \*Nintendo GameCube games (\* = select titles only)

Once you have Go installed, you have 2 options to get the executable up and running.

2.  You may download the executable from the **Releases** section

If you choose to do 1, run `go build /path/to/luna/main.go` in your command prompt or terminal. It may take a little bit, so go ahead and continue reading this while you are at it.
